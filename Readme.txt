This project was originally done in march 2023 and took 1 day to complete, 

I had been watching alot of them algo sorting videos online with the bleeps and wanted to make my own;

this was just to see if I could actually code something like that and honestly it was alot easier than expected. I never did end up implementing sound,
and while i did want to work on using other algo's with this project i settled on a bubble sort for entertainment,

while this project/prototype was successful (requiring python and matplotlibs) I never found motivation to touch this project again.
